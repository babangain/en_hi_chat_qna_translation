all right.
i'm sor@@ ry, you were cutting out i didn't quite get that.
can you please repeat your last question.
i was wond@@ ering if they would be able to sit eight at one table.
one moment, let me check that for you.
it looks like both restaurants can accommodate large parties but you would need to reserve a table at least a week in adv@@ ance.
okay. that sounds good. does it have a full bar@@ ?
it looks like os@@ so has a full bar and harris does not, however they do serve beer and win@@ e.
